Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a 
series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below)
. He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers. The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.
